# Deep-Learning-Image-Recognition projects
1.  The first project was to create a deep learning neural network model to predict an image category. The cifar10 dataset was used to train and test the model.

  The cifar-10 dataset is a large image dataset which labels images into 1 of 10 categories. I created a neural network deep learning model using Dense, Convolutional, MaxPooling, Flatten and Dropout layers. I made predictions using the trained model on new images and the model seemed to work relatively accurately. The model involved using neural networks and convolutional neural networks.

  The cat.png and car.png files are the images that I used to test the model and the notebook for this project is seen in Deep-Learning-Image-Recognition.ipynb.

2.  The second project was to use both a regular neural network model and a convolutional neural network model to predict the digit of a handwritten number. The MNIST dataset was used for this example. I compared the performance of the regular nn and the convolutional nn and it is clear that the convolutional neural network outperforms the regular neural network in terms of accuracy

  The notebook for this project is in Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.ipynb
