# Deep-Learning-Image-Recognition
Creating a deep learning neural network model to predict and image category. The cifar10 dataset was used to train and test the model.

The cifar-10 dataset is a large image dataset which labels images into 1 of 10 categories. I created a neural network deep learning model using Dense, Convolutional, MaxPooling, Flatten and Dropout layers. I made predictions using the trained model on new images and the model seemed to work relatively accurately. The model involved using neural networks and convolutional neural networks.

The cat.png and car.png files are the images that I used to test the model.
